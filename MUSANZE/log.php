        <h1>diseases of maize</h1><br>
        <p> Many farmers store their maize produce for months after harvest with the aim to sell it at the market when the price is high. 
            But this practice often leads to deterioration of the grains due to the lack of proper post-harvest management.</p><br>

            <h1><b>Rwanda's Weather and its Impact on Maize Planting</b></h1>
        <p>Rwanda's diverse geography and climate play a significant role in determining the suitability of different regions for maize cultivation.
             Understanding these factors is crucial for farmers to select the optimal planting time and variety for maximizing yields</p>
             <dl>
                <dt><b>Rwanda's Climate:</b></dt>
                <dt><b>Tropical Climate:</b></dt>
                <dd>Rwanda experiences a warm tropical climate with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons.</dd>
                <img src="tropic.png" class="imgmain">
                <dt><b>Rainfall:</b></dt>
                <dd>The long rainy season occurs from March to May, while the short rainy season falls between September and December.
                     Average annual rainfall varies from 800mm to 1200mm, depending on the region.</dd>
              <dt><b>Temperature:</b></dt> 
              <dd>Temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, averaging between 18°C and 25°C.</dd> 
              <dt><b>Altitude:</b></dt>  
              <dd> Rwanda's altitude ranges from 900m to 4500m, significantly impacting temperature and rainfall patterns.</dd>   
             </dl>
             <h2><b>Maize Planting and Weather Considerations:</b></h2>
             <ul>
                <li><b>Rainfall:</b></li> Adequate rainfall is essential for maize growth and development. 
                    Ideally, planting should occur at the beginning of the rainy season to ensure sufficient moisture for
                     germination and initial growth.
             <li><b>Temperature:</b></li> Maize thrives in warm temperatures, with optimal growth occurring between 20°C and 30°C. 
             Temperatures below 15°C or above 35°C can negatively impact growth and yield
               <li><b>Altitude</b></li>  Different maize varieties are adapted to specific altitude ranges. High-altitude regions require 
               cold-tolerant varieties, while low-altitude regions may benefit from heat-resistant varieties.
            <li><b>Soil type</b></li>The type of soil also plays a crucial role in maize cultivation.
             Well-drained, sandy loam soils with a pH of 6.0-7.0 are most suitable for maize growth.
